/** The receive half of a multiplexed stream.
 *
 * Buffers incoming STREAM data and hands it to the application's
 * `ReadableStream` *on demand* (pull-driven). `onConsume` fires only when bytes
 * are actually delivered to the reader — never on mere receipt — so flow-control
 * credit (MAX_STREAM_DATA) tracks the application's read rate. Combined with the
 * sender claiming credit before sending, this bounds how far the peer can run
 * ahead of a slow reader: it can buffer at most one receive window of undelivered
 * data before its credit is exhausted.
 *
 * A zero high-water mark prevents the `ReadableStream` from prefetching even one
 * chunk before the application issues a read; all undelivered data stays in the
 * explicitly flow-controlled queue below.
